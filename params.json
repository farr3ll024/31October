The vast majority of these files were simply automated junit tests. Much of our testing was also done outside of the testpackage, within the production package. The tests in production were generally carried out using mock objects. You can use this link to view some of our testing within the repository <https://github.com/farr3ll024/CS2820/tree/new_master/CS2820/src/testpackage>\r\n* Documentation of interaction(javadoc): \r\n\r\n# Current Progress\r\nAt the moment our project works to be cohesively and completes our simulation without crashing. We've tested the simulation with several different iteration amounts. Since we don't have a visualizer our visual is currently just the simulation status which is printed to a console. ![](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-FK-urvl1hedml2cnRfMWVzd2M)\r\n\r\n# What's Left?\r\nOur goals for the next day consist of creating a simple visual, verifying that each order from our database works within the simulation, finish the implementation of our documentation method. Each object should write to a different text file documenting object specific information(i.e. battery percentage, current task, etc.)\r\n\r\n# What was difficult\r\nThe hardest part for our group was finding times to meet that work for all of us\r\n\r\n",
